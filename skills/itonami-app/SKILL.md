# Itonami App

The bundled `itonami-fleet` MCP server (`bin/itonami-mcp`) serves the
actor catalog. It needs no session and makes no network calls.

## Search the catalog

Call `fleet_search` with any of `text`, `domain`, `isic`, `iso3166`,
`maturity`, `execution`, `callable`, `limit`. Every field is optional.
Results carry `repo`, `id`, `name`, `domain`, and execution info.

```
fleet_search {"text": "invoice triage", "callable": true, "limit": 5}
```

`fleet_call` is not on this host. When a hit names a repo the operator
can run, say which repo and entrypoint to use instead of calling it.

## Open the app

Call `itonami_open` with `{}`. It answers the app identity, the UI
resource, and the local URL (`http://127.0.0.1:1338` by default,
`CLOUD_ITONAMI_PORT` overrides). It never needs a session or arguments.
